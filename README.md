# Technical Exercise (Publish/Subscribe pattern)

Weâ€™d like you to produce a small solution that demonstrates the concepts of the Publish/Subscribe pattern.



#### We want to get a better understanding of
- the code you produce
- how you go about architecting an extensible solution




#### Task
Edit the current solution to do the following:
- Take an input of data
- Transform that data in some way
- Transport that data to a set of subscribers
- Have the subscribers display the transformed data
- Feel free to add more class library projects or Unit Testing projects
- Don't add reference to producer project from subscriber or viseversa

You are free to use **third-party libraries** to help with some aspects of it.

Solution should be testable, we are not looking for 100% code coverage but show examples of how you make  parts unit-testable.

#### Acceptance criterion:
- Exec unit tests
- Run Publisher
- Run DesktopSubscriber
- Run MobileSubscriber
- We should be able to write something from Publisher.exe and see it received and transformed by subscribers

#### Notes:
- Please don't make it more complex than necessary.
- We would like to see a piece of code as you would do on your normal working day.
- Please don't fork this project and create your own repository.
